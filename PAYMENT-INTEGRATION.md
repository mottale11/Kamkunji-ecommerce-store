# üí≥ M-Pesa Payment Integration with Lipia Online

## Overview

This e-commerce website now includes a fully integrated M-Pesa payment system using the Lipia Online API. Users can complete their purchases by receiving an M-Pesa STK push notification on their phones.

## üöÄ Features

- **Real-time M-Pesa Integration**: Direct integration with Lipia Online payment gateway
- **STK Push Notifications**: Users receive payment prompts on their phones

- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages for various payment scenarios
- **Payment Status Tracking**: Real-time payment status updates
- **Phone Number Validation**: Automatic formatting and validation of Kenyan phone numbers

## üîß Technical Implementation

### 1. Payment Service (`src/services/payments.ts`)

The core payment logic is handled by the `PaymentService` class:

```typescript
export class PaymentService {
  // Initiate M-Pesa STK push payment
  static async initiatePayment(phone: string, amount: number): Promise<PaymentResponse>
  
  // Validate phone number format
  static validatePhoneNumber(phone: string): boolean
  
  // Format phone number for display
  static formatPhoneNumber(phone: string): string
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Phone number formatting (ensures 07XXXXXXXX format)
- Amount validation and formatting
- Error handling for various payment scenarios
- Integration with Lipia Online API

### 2. API Endpoint (`src/app/api/payments/route.ts`)

Server-side payment processing endpoint:

```typescript
POST /api/payments
{
  "phone": "0768793923",
  "amount": "25000"
}
```

**Validation:**
- Phone number format validation
- Amount validation (positive number)
- Required field validation
- Error response handling

### 3. Checkout Page (`src/app/checkout/page.tsx`)

Enhanced checkout experience with:

- **Form Validation**: Comprehensive input validation
- **Payment Status Management**: Real-time status updates
- **User Feedback**: Clear success/error messages
- **Phone Number Formatting**: Live phone number preview
- **Payment Instructions**: Clear M-Pesa payment guidance

## üì± Payment Flow

### Step 1: User Fills Checkout Form
- User enters shipping information
- Phone number is validated and formatted
- Form validation ensures all required fields are completed

### Step 2: Payment Initiation
- User clicks "Place Order & Pay with M-PESA"
- Frontend validates form data
- API call is made to `/api/payments`
- Payment request is sent to Lipia Online

### Step 3: M-Pesa STK Push

## üîë Configuration

### Environment Variables

The payment system uses the following configuration:
